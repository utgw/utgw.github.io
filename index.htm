<h2>1 March 2014</h2>
<p>
Today I have 2 events I wanna tell you.</p>
<p>
One is that I have bought <i>Touhou Suzunaan</i> (Forbidden Scrollery) vol. 1 and Hourai Doll ~ Dolls in Pseudo Paradise at Melonbooks.
I have thought that Motoori Kosuzu is SO cute (as Rumia and Sekibanki, though I can't assert which is the cutest,) but haven't had any books, so I have wanted it for a long time;
as the CD contains many musics I have ever listened to at Touhou Gensouteki Ongaku (ZUN's old music works,) I bought it without hesitating.
Both will cheer me up!</p>
<p>
And another is that our family have a new used personal computer (Windows 7 32bit) for family except me.
It seems a little old, but enough to see the Internet.
In fact, we had used Windows XP until 2 days before; it was so slow, so insecure, and so weak.
Finally our family started to use an stable personal computer.

I got a flu 7 days ago, so hard days have passed.
Now I am fine, but nose is running a little.
